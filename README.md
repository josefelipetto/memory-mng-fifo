# memory-mng-fifo
Fifo memory management algorithm

To test the algorithm, just call the function execute, that expects 3 parameters: the linked list with the values to be managed,
the number of frames of the memory you want to simulate and the number of file just for output reasons. I've created a function
called test, that test the algorithm with four different files and number of frames.
